Only changes to the silkscreen have been made.
- Fixed value for 5v linear regulator: LM7802 -> LM7805
- Fixed layer for MCU values: Values Top -> Silkscreen Top
- Fixed ammeter capacitor labels on silkscreen: Previously covering small part of each pad
- Repositioned the 'WayWayWay' label to look more centered between the screen and GND label for the potentiometers

Since these are only changes to the silkscreen, and the text on the pads can be scrapped off if it presents an issue, 
a new order will not be made for these board unless they prove to be defective and the circuit itself needs to change.
However, after this many revisions and attempts at getting this to work, this should be a functional board that will
meet the needs of the project, so just move on if it does and keep these updated files since they have the same circuit 
as the working model, just fixed the silkscreen.
