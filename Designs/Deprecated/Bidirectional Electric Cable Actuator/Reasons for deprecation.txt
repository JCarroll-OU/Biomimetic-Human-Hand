Unit cost was too high. Parts required tight tolerances which meant higher production costs. 
Design took up too much space. More efficient and simplistic designs could be used.
Design did not allow for compliant motion; manually moving a joint will not be detected and corrected with this setup.

This part of the project helped determine design constraints that were previously unconsidered or improperly considered.
	The problems with the design listed above led to a redesign of how the robot would look and function.
		Potentiometers are now integrated into each joint. Since space is so limited within the hand itself,
		all actuators will sit in the forearm assembly and pull each joint via a 1mm 304-stainless-steel 
		control cable. Each cable is controlled by an N20 motor geared down to 300 RPM at 3V. 
		This design change was necessitated by the fact that a servo motor would be the most ideal solution
		if it was not for their size. Building numerous 'servos' into a single board allows for a lower
		unit cost than using traditional servo motors and saves a lot of space since they are combined into the
		same housing.
